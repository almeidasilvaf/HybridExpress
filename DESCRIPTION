Description: HybridExpress can be used to perform comparative transcriptomics
    analysis of hybrids (or allopolyploids) relative to their
    progenitor species. The package features functions to perform exploratory
    analyses of sample grouping, identify differentially expressed genes
    in hybrids relative to their progenitors, classify genes in expression
    categories (N = 12) and classes (N = 5),
    and perform functional analyses. We also provide users with graphical
    functions for the seamless creation of publication-ready figures that are
    commonly used in the literature.
